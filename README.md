# About the Project

Using a dataset containing information about historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, I attempted to create a supervised machine learning model capable of classifying the creditworthiness of an individual.  
Data was read in, cleaned, and then split into testing and training data.  
I made a function to run through fitting and testing and evaluating ML models.  
I ran thru a large variety of ML models and found that none were capable of producing results good enough to be considered seriously as a product to be used.  
I came to the conclusion that more steps were needed in the data preparation stage to allow for the models to be better.
